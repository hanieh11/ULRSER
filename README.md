[](http://dx.doi.org/10.21437/Interspeech.2019-2769)

This is a clean re-implementation to reproduce the results to further understand the speech emotion recogonition (SER) process. 
*NOTE* The access to all original datasets were not possible, therefore the collected result is solely for the [EMO-DP](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piyushagni5/berlin-database-of-emotional-speech-emodb) by Kaggle.
